; (b) Tests with population sizes
; Population Size	Average Individuals	Sample Size
; 4						650.840					2	(takes long to calculate)
; 8						139.368					8	(fastest to calculate)
; 16						175.576					4
; 24						100.392					4
; 32						305.536					1	(takes forever to calculate)
;
; A population size of 4 seems too small to yield good results and 32 seems too large.
; 8 seemed to generate the best solution the fastest, the average value is high due to one outlier,
;	which needed 600.000 generations to find a solution.
